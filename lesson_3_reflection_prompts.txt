When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
That would help me work across multiple devices, have multiple collaborators, and backup data in case of a Tsunami :p


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because we may be on a different branch working on something else, pull may cause a major havoc here by adding wrong data to current branch.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
Brnaches are when you want to work on two separate things in the same project.
Clones are when you want to copy your/other work and add your modifications etc
Fork is github's private invention, to make sure the original creator gets the credit and also makes the process of cloning to server easily.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
It helps git keep track of changes in remoote repo so that code can be merged effectively while syncing.
Also, it helps us by saving remote changes offline for viewing later.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?
Obviously it would be hard to review the code, also it would be difficult because only one person would be able to work at a time.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
That keeps a working master branch while we're working on other features. That way our work is still presentable as well as under development.
